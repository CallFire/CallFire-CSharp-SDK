Getting Started
===============

The CallFire API provides a robust interface to control functionality available through the regular web interface,
plus some controls which are not otherwise accessible.

This library provides a set of C# classes to interface with the
[CallFire API](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation). Please refer to the
[API documentation](http://www.callfire.com/api-documentation) for information
on finding your API credentials.

There are two separate, but largely equivalent, endpoints by which you can
access the CallFire API. These are the REST and SOAP APIs.
