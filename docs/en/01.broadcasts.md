Broadcasts
==========

## List Configured Broadcasts

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var cfQueryBroadcasts = new CfQueryBroadcasts();
var cfBroadcastQueryResult = broadcastClient.QueryBroadcasts(cfQueryBroadcasts);

if (cfBroadcastQueryResult.Broadcast != null)
{
	var broadcastList = new string[cfBroadcastQueryResult.Broadcast.Count()];
	for (var i = 0; i < cfBroadcastQueryResult.Broadcast.Count(); i++)
	{
		var cfBroadcast = cfBroadcastQueryResult.Broadcast[i];
		broadcastList[i] = string.Format("{0} {1} - Status: {2} Last Modified: {3} Type: {4}",
			cfBroadcast.Name, cfBroadcast.Id, cfBroadcast.Status, cfBroadcast.LastModified, cfBroadcast.Type);
	}
}
```

## Starting a Configured Broadcast

Issue a ControlBroadcast request with a command of `START`.  

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var broadcastId = 1234567890;
var cfControlBroadcast = new CfControlBroadcast(broadcastId, null, CfBroadcastCommand.Start, null);
broadcastClient.ControlBroadcast(ControlBroadcast);
```

## Loading Contacts into a Broadcast

Load contacts into a broadcast's contact batch.

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var broadcastId = 1234567890;
var batchName = "My Contact Batch";

var contact_1 = new CfContact();
contact_1.Id = 15551231234;
contact_1.FirstName = "John";
contact_1.LastName = "Doe";

var contact_2 = new CfContact();
contact_2.Id = 15551231235;
contact_2.FirstName = "Jane";
contact_2.LastName = "Smith";

object[] contactList = { contact_1,  contact_2};
	
var client = new RestBroadcastClient("api-login", "api-password");

CreateContactBatch = new CfCreateContactBatch(null, broadcastId, batchName, contactList, false);
var id = broadcastClient.CreateContactBatch(CreateContactBatch);
```
