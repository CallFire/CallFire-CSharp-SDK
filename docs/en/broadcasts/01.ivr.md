IVR Broadcasts
==============

## Create a New IVR Broadcast

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var cfBroadcastConfig = CfIvrBroadcastConfig();
cfBroadcastConfig.FromNumber = "15551231234" // A valid Caller ID number
cfBroadcastConfig.DialplanXml = string.Format("{0} {1}", "<dialplan><play type=\"tts\">Congratulations!",
 "You have successfully configured a CallFire I V R.</play></dialplan>");

var cfBroadcast = new CfBroadcast();
cfBroadcast.Name = "My CallFire Broadcast";
cfBroadcast.Type = CfBroadcastType.Ivr;
cfBroadcast.Item = cfBroadcastConfig;

var createBroadcast = new CfBroadcastRequest();
createBroadcast.Broadcast = cfBroadcast;

var id = broadcastClient.CreateBroadcast(createBroadcast);
```
