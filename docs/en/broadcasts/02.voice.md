================

## Create a New Voice Broadcast (with data)

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var soundId = 123456789; // Some existing sound ID

var cfBroadcastConfig = CfVoiceBroadcastConfig();
cfBroadcastConfig.FromNumber = "15551231234"; // A valid Caller ID number
cfBroadcastConfig.AnsweringMachineConfig = CfAnsweringMachineConfig.LiveImmediate;
cfBroadcastConfig.Item = soundId;

var cfBroadcast = new CfBroadcast();
cfBroadcast.Name = "My CallFire Broadcast";
cfBroadcast.Type = CfBroadcastType.Voice;
cfBroadcast.Item = cfBroadcastConfig;

var createBroadcast = new CfBroadcastRequest();
createBroadcast.Broadcast = cfBroadcast;

var id = broadcastClient.CreateBroadcast(createBroadcast);
```
