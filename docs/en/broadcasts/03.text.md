Text Broadcasts
===============

## Create a New Text Broadcast

```c#
var client = new CallfireClient("api-login", "api-password", CallfireClients.Rest);
var broadcastClient = client.Broadcasts;

var cfBroadcastConfig = CfTextBroadcastConfig();
cfBroadcastConfig.FromNumber = "67076"; // CallFire shared short code
cfBroadcastConfig.Message = "Hello World!";

var cfBroadcast = new CfBroadcast();
cfBroadcast.Name = "My CallFire Broadcast";
cfBroadcast.Type = CfBroadcastType.Text;
cfBroadcast.Item = cfBroadcastConfig;

var createBroadcast = new CfBroadcastRequest();
createBroadcast.Broadcast = cfBroadcast;

var id = broadcastClient.CreateBroadcast(createBroadcast);
}
```
